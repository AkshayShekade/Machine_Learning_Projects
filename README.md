Welcome to the ML Projects repository! 🎉🎈

This repository contains a diverse collection of machine learning projects, each showcasing different techniques and methodologies.

🚨 **What You Will Find:**

- Projects that focus on a wide range of datasets and domains.
- A variety of machine learning techniques, from exploratory data analysis to advanced model building and evaluation.
- Each project is contained within its folder and includes:
  - A Jupyter notebook of the projects (`.ipynb`).
  - A dataset  used in the project (`.csv` or other formats).
  - Summary of the project (`Readme. md`) detailed README file explaining the specific ML project, dataset, and findings.
  
🎈 I hope these projects will inspire and provide valuable insights to anyone interested in machine learning.<br>
